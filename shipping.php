<div class="faqtitle">How do I know whether the product can be delivered to my area? Can I opt for Cash On Delivery (COD) payment in my area?</div>
<p>G N S Audios  is trying its best to ship its products as far and wide as possible. However, there are still a few areas where we are unable to ship. While placing an order, you will receive an intimation of the same. Similarly, you will also be informed on whether or not the Cash On Delivery (COD) payment option is available in your respective area.</p>


<div class="faqtitle">A few months ago, I had ordered from G N S Audios  and the order was delivered successfully to my address. However, this time, I am unable to place an order as my Pincode is not being recognised. Why so?</div>
<p>There were a few areas and Pincodes that were serviced by G N S Audios  earlier; however, they are unserviceable now due to courier issues. If you are trying to place an order using one of these Pincodes, we won't be able to take your order. We regret the inconvenience. To place your order successfully, we request you to provide a different / alternate address with a serviceable Pincode. Please get in touch with our Customer Service on +91 9999912345 to know which Pincodes are serviceable.

<div class="faqtitle">What is the mode of delivery at G N S Audios ?</div>
<p>We have partnered with GATI courier services for the shipment of products across India and FEDEX courier services for international shipments. Depending upon your location and reach, we also make use of several other trustworthy domestic service providers to deliver products.</p>


<div class="faqtitle">Why have I received only a part of my order?</div>
<p>As mentioned in our Product details page, each product has its own delivery duration. Please note that, if you have ordered multiple items, the entire order may not be delivered together and you would be receiving partial shipments, as each product may be delivered as per the individual delivery timeline. However we try and send maximum products from your order in one shipment.</p>
